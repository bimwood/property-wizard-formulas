The above format is simple and efficient.  Any user can apply enter information quickly into the [PropertyWizard](https://apps.autodesk.com/en/Publisher/PublisherHomepage?ID=K3XURSQAXDBW) dialog.  We are NOT going to share the GUID's that [PropertyWizard](https://apps.autodesk.com/en/Publisher/PublisherHomepage?ID=K3XURSQAXDBW) creates and manages for obvious reasons.

### The Future
The more people who contribute the more fancy and organized the site might become.  For now it is a good minimum viable product.
