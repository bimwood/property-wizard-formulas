### Example Contribution Format  
*Name*: cridder<br/>
*GitHub*: https://github.com/cridder<br/>
*LinkedIn*: https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisridder/<br/>
*Description of the PropertyWizard Formula use/goals/etc*: Sets the out of the box Mark parameter to the element id on all doors.  Eliminates any and all warning messages about duplicate Mark values.  Mark values are meant to be unique.<br/>
*Category*: Doors<br/>
*Target Property*: Mark<br/>
*Formula*: Id<br/>

---

The above format is simple and efficient.  Any user can apply enter information quickly into the PropertyWizard dialog.  We are NOT going to share the GUID's that PropertyWizard creates and manages for obvious reasons.

### The Future
The more people who contribute the more fancy and organized the site might become.  For now it is a good minimum viable product.

Thanks.
